		<h1>a short bio-discography about Kendrick Lamar</h1>
		<p>
			Kendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper and
			singer-songwriter. Known for his cinematic storytelling, melodic cadences,
			and artistic reinventions, he is regarded as one of the most influential
			artists of his generation, earning him the nickname "King Kendrick". He
			was named the second-greatest rapper of all time by Billboard and Vibe in
			2023.
		</p>
		<p>
			American rapper Kendrick Lamar has released five studio albums, one
			compilation album, one extended play (EP), five mixtapes, 65 singles
			(including 44 as a featured artist), and three promotional singles.
			<br />
			<br />
			Lamar initially performed under the stage name K.Dot, releasing three
			mixtapes under that moniker: Y.H.N.I.C. (Hub City Threat: Minor of the
			Year) (2004), Training Day (2005), and C4 (2009).
			<br />
			<br />
			He gained major attention after the release of his fourth mixtape Overly
			Dedicated, which was released in 2010. It was Lamar's first full-length
			project to be released under his birth name and fared well enough to enter
			the United States Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, where it peaked
			at number 72.
			<br />
			<br />
			Lamar's debut studio album Section.80, was released on July 2, 2011, and
			issued on independent record label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). It peaked
			at number 113 on the US Billboard 200 chart. The album's lead single,
			"HiiiPoWeR", was released prior to the album through iTunes.
			<br />
			<br />
			In mid-2012, Lamar began promoting his second studio album and major label
			debut, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City. The album's first single, "The Recipe",
			peaked at number 38 on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.
			"Swimming Pools (Drank)", the album's lead single, peaked at number 17 on
			the US Billboard Hot 100 and became his first top 20 hit on the chart.
			Good Kid, M.A.A.D City was released in October 2012, through TDE,
			Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. The album received
			universal critical acclaim and reached number two on the Billboard 200.
			<br />
			<br />
			On March 16, 2015, Lamar released his third studio album, To Pimp a
			Butterfly. The album was preceded by two singles, "I" and "The Blacker the
			Berry", which charted at numbers 39 and 66 on the US Billboard Hot 100,
			respectively. To Pimp a Butterfly received universal critical acclaim upon
			release, much like its predecessor, and had global charting success,
			debuting at number one on the overall albums charts in Australia, Canada,
			New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, as well as topping the US Billboard
			200.
			<br />
			<br />
			On March 4, 2016, Lamar released Untitled Unmastered, a compilation album
			containing previously unreleased demos that originated during the
			recording of To Pimp a Butterfly. The compilation album gave Lamar his
			second chart-topping set in less than a year.
			<br />
			<br />
			On April 14, 2017, his fourth studio album, Damn, was released and reached
			number one on the Billboard 200, and has since been certified 3Ã— Platinum.
			The album spawned the singles "Humble", "Loyalty" and "Love", which all
			reached the top 15 of the US Billboard Hot 100, with "Humble" becoming his
			first number-one single in the United States as a lead artist.
			<br />
			<br />
			Lamar's fifth studio album Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers was released on
			May 13, 2022, as his final project under TDE.
